## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This server is part of a tool called WIMP (WOMP Intel Management Program). The purpose of this server is to process and store intel coming from in-game chat channels. The server provides an API for submitting and retrieving intel information.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Install the following:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). A distributed version control system.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Open source code editor.
* [NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). The SDK also includes the Runtime.
* The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.

After installing the prerequisites you can verify the installed dotnet version by typing this command in the terminal:
```
dotnet --version
```

### Installing
Follow these steps to get started working with the project:

Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:agelito/wimp-server.git
```

Open the cloned project with Visual Studio Code:

```
code wimp-server
```

Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code:

```
ctrl+shift+`
```

Install any missing NuGet packages:
```
dotnet restore
```

Build and run the application, because there's two projects we'll have to specify the `.csproj` file as well:
```
dotnet run --project WIMP-Server/WIMP-Server.csproj
```

The application should now run with default configuration options. See [usage](#usage) section for information about how to configure the application. 

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Running the server <a name="running"></a>
Run the application in development environment using `dotnet run` command:
```
dotnet run --project WIMP-Server/WIMP-Server.csproj
```

The server will populate the database first time it's run, be patient since this could take some time.

### Configuring the server <a name="configuration"></a>
The server is using the `appsettings.json` file for configuration. It's also possible to have different configurations for different environments by naming the file `appsettings.Development.json` or `appsettings.Production.json`:
```
# Default configuration file
WIMP-Server/appsettings.json

# Developmment configuration file
WIMP-Server/appsettings.Development.json

# Production configuration file
WIMP-Server/appsettings.Production.json
```

The following configuration options is available:
Key | Description | Example
---|---|---
EsiService | The Eve ESI server endpoint to use. | https://esi.evetech.net

***appsettings.Development.json Example***
```
